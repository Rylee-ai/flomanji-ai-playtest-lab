# GM Notes

A classic saboteur objective that creates tension without requiring direct betrayal. The player will try to create situations that increase Heat or prevent Heat reduction.

# Player Strategy

The player should:
- Suggest risky plans that might increase Heat
- Discourage or sabotage actions that would reduce Heat
- Position themselves to survive even if the mission fails
