# GM Notes

The Flomanji Man represents the chaos and unpredictability of the setting. This encounter should be played for both humor and tension, as players never quite know if this interaction will help or harm them.

# Effects

- On encounter: Immediate Weirdness check required
- Success grants luck but failure impacts both mental state and action economy
- Can be used as a story hook for bigger events
