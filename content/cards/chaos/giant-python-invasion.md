# GM Notes

This chaos card represents Florida's actual problem with invasive Burmese pythons, scaled up to Flomanji proportions. The mobility restrictions create strategic challenges.

# Effects

- Creates no-go zones for unprepared characters
- Significantly impacts exploration in natural areas
- Encourages machete or other python-handling gear
