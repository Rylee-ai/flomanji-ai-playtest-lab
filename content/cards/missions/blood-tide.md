# GM Notes

A tense mission with escalating Heat that forces players to move quickly. The environmental hazard (water contact) creates interesting movement constraints.

# Setup Instructions

1. Place the Research Lab tile on one edge of the map
2. Distribute water sample tokens on coastal tiles
3. Place survivor tokens on the opposite side from extraction
4. Add appropriate coastal and toxic hazards to the encounter deck

# Key Challenges

- Time pressure from increasing Heat
- Risk vs reward of water contact
- Rescue coordination with limited actions
