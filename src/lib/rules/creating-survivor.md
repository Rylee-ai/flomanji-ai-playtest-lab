## 2  Creating Your Survivor

Every great Flonaki tale begins with a hardenedâ€”and a bit unhingedâ€”Survivor. In this chapter you'll assemble your card, equip your starting hand, and launch into the danger.
ðŸ’¡ *Layout Notes:* Survivor cards are pokerâ€‘size, doubleâ€‘sided. Front shows Stats, Ability, tracking spots; back shows flavor art and starter gear slots.

**2.1  Survivor Card Components**

- **Name & Role:** Your title and archetype (e.g. Eddie "Airboat" Alvarez â€” Everglades Tour Guide).
- **Stats:** Five core attributesâ€”**Brawn, Moxie, Charm, Grit, Weird Sense**â€”to which you assign 5 Upgrade Points (no stat may exceed 5 at start).
- **Unique Ability:** Oneâ€‘line trait that triggers during play (see examples).
- **Health:** Track on your personal d6 (start at 5; at 0 you are **Incapacitated**).
- **Weirdness:** Use your personal d10, starting at 0, to track Weirdness (flip to a Flonakiified card at 10).
- **Luck Tokens:** Represented by your Luck d6, start with half your Stat total (rounded up).
- **Starter Gear Slots (5):** Place your opening five Gear cards here.
