## 1  Welcome to Flonaki

*"When Flonaki Man meets survival horror, you're in for one wild ride."*
Flonaki is a **semiâ€‘coâ€‘operative cardâ€‘andâ€‘dice adventure** for 2â€“6 players. Set in a heightened 1987 Flonaki, it blends survivalâ€‘horror tension with tongueâ€‘inâ€‘cheek 'Flonaki Man' absurdity. Every session unfolds like a oneâ€‘shot Bâ€‘movie: outrun hurricanes, barter with swamp witches, and â€” if you're lucky â€” escape the entity known only as *Flonaki* before it eats the Sunshine State alive.

ðŸ’¡ *Sidebar:* Flonaki draws DNA from: **Eldritch Horror** (coâ€‘op tension), **Dead of Winter** (modular missions), and **Battlestar Galactica** (traitor jeopardy).

**1.1  The Core Loop**
Each round pulses with rising stakes through this fiveâ€‘step loop:

1. **Draw Trouble**
    - Reveal a card from the Trouble deck (Gear, Hazard, NPC, or Event) to unleash new obstacles or opportunities.
2. **Take Two Actions**
    - Move, use equipment, rest, teamâ€‘up, or advance the Mission.
3. **Chaos Strikes**
    - Unleash one Chaos card â€” the world escalates.
4. **Advance the Timers**
    - Global **Heat** ticks upward; personal **Weirdness** may spike.
5. **Repeat**
    - Until you beat the Missionâ€¦ or the Sunshine State burns.

> Worked Example: Eddie "Airboat" Alvarez draws Hazard 'Swamp Witch's Curse,' spends Charm, fails DC 11 â€” gains 2 Weirdness, discards his bug spray, and the horror deepens.
